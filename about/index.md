Hi. I'm Matt Swanson.

I'm a software engineer who values lightweight agile processes, TDD, and good design. But above all: shipping.

I enjoy building simple apps that people love using.

I live and [work](http://www.sep.com/) in Indianapolis, IN. I went to school at [Purdue University](http://www.purdue.edu/) ([ECE &rsquo;10](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE)). I do a little bit of everything, but I'm happiest working with Ruby or Android.

I'm always learning and trying to improve my craft; I consider writing software to be one of my most enjoyable hobbies and usually have some kind of side-project I'm hacking on. I come at problems with an Engineer's Mindset and am always striving to write clean, readable code.

I help run a non-profit that helps connect local developers ([Indy Hackers](http://indyhackers.org/)).

I watch way too much TV.
