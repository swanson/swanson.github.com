Hi. I'm Matt Swanson.

I'm a product engineer who values lightweight processes, good design, and boring code.

I live in Indianapolis, IN and currently work at [Arrows](https://arrows.to/). I studied engineering at [Purdue University](http://www.purdue.edu/) ([ECE &rsquo;10](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE)). I'm happiest working in Ruby on Rails.

I write [Boring Rails](https://boringrails.com/) - a collection of articles, tips, and tricks for intermediate and advanced Rails development that sticks close to the default stack.

For five years, I helped run a non-profit that connects local developers, designers, and product people in Indianapolis ([Indy Hackers](http://indyhackers.org/)).

I love weird, niche sports leagues and have won over $15k playing Canadian (CFL) fantasy football.

I watch way too much TV.
