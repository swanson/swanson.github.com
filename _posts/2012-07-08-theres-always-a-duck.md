[There's Always a Duck: A collection of essays about people, culture, and teams][link]   
Elisabeth Hendrickson

**What's the point?**  
The book is a collection of essays written the point-of-view of a test/QA engineer on 
agile teams about soft skills and personal interactions.

**How was it?**  
It was alright. The book offers a different perspective from typical "software team"
books I have read because of the author's background as a tester. As I continue my study
of TDD and testing, I thought this would be a new and interesting angle to consider.

There were some good stories; I particularly liked the section describing a project
with a 5-digit bug backlog (as I could empathize given my current project's ever-growing 
list). I also liked the concept of the ["Agile Up To Here"][event] event that was 
described and will have to check the author's blog for more details.

Nothing earth-shattering, but it was a short, pleasant read.

**Who should read it?**  
Developers looking for some insight into how testing fits into agile teams from a 
Test/QA engineer POV
