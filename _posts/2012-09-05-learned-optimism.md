**What's the point?**  
Optimism has proven benefits over pessimism is nearly every aspect of life, from 
personal happiness to success in business. People can learn to become helpless
and pessimistic, but luckily they can also learn to be become an optimist.
 
**How was it?**  
The book has a fairly extensive backstory that follows the researcher's journey to 
understand [learned helplessness][lh] and optimism. It was interesting to see how 
Seligman took his findings from animals and applied them to humans. I am always 
intrigued by how psychologists can design an experiment to objectively capture how
people feel.

The book includes a test to determine your "optimism level". As expected, my results were
pessimistic. 

But it was very revealing to see which categories I was worse in. For 
instance, I scored poorly for the "Permanence Bad" section; this means that my internal 
explanatory style (how you rationalize things in your mind) tends to make bad things 
seem permanent ("I suck at X, I always have and always will"). But I scored highly in 
"Pervasiveness Good", meaning that when something good happened, I allowed that feeling 
to improve other areas of my life.

The secret sauce to becoming more optimistic is training yourself to think about 
good events as long-lasting and far-reaching and bad events as temporary, isolated, and
beyond your control.
 
**Who should read it?**  
If you're into pop psychology books (like I am), then it's worth a read. There is some
fascinating stuff about using optimism tests when hiring insurance salesmen that might
also work for hiring developers.
