[![The Pragmatic Programmer](/static/pragmatic-programmer.jpg)][pp]  
[The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master][pp]  
Andrew Hunt, David Thomas  

The Pragmatic Programmer is widely considered as one of the most important books for developers. 
Even though it was written over 10 years ago, it holds up extremely well over time because it 
focuses less of specific technologies and more on solid methodologies and fundamental skills.

For a new developer, this book is a whirlwind tour that &mdash; in a manageable 250 pages &mdash; covers 
everything from getting the most out of your development tools to software design principles to career 
development and how to work in a team environment.

Sections to pay close attention to: 
* __Communicate!__: a crash course in technical communications
* __Tracer Bullets__: write a barebones, end-to-end skeleton
* __Decoupling and the Law of Demeter__: smaller modules with minimal dependencies are good
* __Programming by Coincidence__: learn to program deliberately

Alternative: [Clean Code][cc] (more focused on the mechanics of writing good code)

[![Apprenticeship Patterns](/static/apprenticeship-patterns.png)][ap]    
[Apprenticeship Patterns: Guidance for Aspiring Software Craftsman][ap]  
Dave Hoover, Adewale Oshineye  

Following the Pattern Language format, this book focuses on the journey from beginner developer
to journeyman to master and introduces the concept of Software Craftsmanship. I was a little worried
that the authors were stalking me because so many of the "Context" sections captured exactly with how 
I felt during my first six months as a professional developer.

This book is less popular than others, but it has been the most impactful book I've found for starting 
a career in software. There is so much fantastic advice in this book that it deserves to be more
known.

Sections to pay close attention to:
* __The Long Road__: keep your focus on the long term, value growth over salary
* __Find Mentors__: seek out and learn from those that are ahead of you
* __Create Feedback Loops__: how to get useful feedback
* __Confront your Ignorance__: what to do when you identify a skill gap that you need for daily work

Alternative: [The Passionate Programmer][pass] (more story/interview based)

[![Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby](/static/poodr.png)][poodr]    
[Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby: An Agile Primer][poodr]  
Sandi Metz

Don't let the `in Ruby` part of the title scare you off if you are in a .NET shop &mdash; there is plenty
of general purpose advice for designing software that is a joy to work with and easy to modify. Metz 
has a very friendly writing style and this book explains concepts with an ease that is lacking in other
books on the subject of design (I'm looking at you Gang of Four...).

This book is a great introduction to some more advanced design concepts &mdash; dependency injection,
Tell Don't Ask, role behavior, object composition &mdash; that doesn't feel overwhelming. A new developer
won't pick up and master every concept the first time, but it is good to get exposure as early as possible.

Sections to pay close attention to:
* __Deciding What Belongs in a Class__: introduction to SRP, code that is easy to change
* __Writing Loosely Coupled Code__: managing dependencies and choosing dependency direction
* __Creating Flexible Interfaces__: thinking about Messages
* __Designing Cost-Effective Tests__: a gentle introduction to testing and TDD

Alternative: [Growing Object Oriented Software, Guided by Tests][go] (more advanced with heavy emphasis on TDD)
