**What's the point?**  
It seems like a small group of experts would be best at making intelligent 
predictions and decisions, but, under the right circumstances, a group of 
non-experts acting as one can be smarter than the sums of its parts. 

The book outlines the necessary requirements to create a "wise crowd" and provides a 
variety of examples to demonstrate their effectiveness.

**How was it?**  
While it was an interesting read, I didn't find much in terms of actionable 
take-aways. The examples in the book are really interesting (especially a story 
about a naval officer using crowdsourced predictions to locate a sunken submarine) - 
but I don't know how I can really use the information directly. 

I suppose you can apply the crowdsourcing idea to things like estimating software 
projects, but I think it is already obvious that getting a group of people with 
varied experiences is useful.

**Who should read it?**  
In the end, it was a very approachable book about behavioral economics (which I like)
in the same genre and style of Freakonomics and Malcolm Gladwell (which I also 
like), but those looking for new and pragmatic approaches will probably be letdown.
