I learned an RSpec naming convention while pairing with a [developer][vam] at 
[Global Day of Code Retreat][cr].

I learned about using `bundle open` to explore Ruby gems while pairing with a [friend][ks] at 
a sandwich shop.

I learned about debugging with `pry` while pairing with a [guy][jm] at an 
[Indy.rb Hack Night][irb].

And I've shared each of these bits of knowledge with co-workers in code reviews and pairing
sessions.

These nuggets of information are all available in other sources &mdash; books, blog 
posts, mailing lists &mdash; but they are *unknown-unknowns*. I didn't even realize there 
was a better way that I should be seeking out.

But when pairing, I can see you use a cool trick. You teach me how to do it. I teach it to a 
co-worker. She teaches it to her team. Everyone improves and grows.

Pair programming **cross-pollinates** knowledge.

If you can't think of the last time you picked up a new trick, seek out someone new and 
pair for an hour. I'd love for you to share what you learn with me someday.
