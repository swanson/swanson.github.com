**What's the point?**  
Success comes from out-working your competition. If you are really passionate
about something, you can make money at it &mdash; but it will be a long and
unglamorous road.

**How was it?**  
Very mixed opinions on this one. It was very motivational and I appreciated
concrete steps for building a brand and audience (although some of it seemed
a little spammy).

But at the same time, I didn't really learn any new skills or gain perspective.

I was also convinced by the next book I read &mdash; [So Good They Can't Ignore You][good]
&mdash; that following your passionate is not a good idea and doesn't even lead to
happiness in your work life.

**Who should read it?**  
If you are dead-set on trying out the "lifestyle design" path that is popular
these days, I think this book is helpful and provides a place to start. Just be
sure to be a bit skeptical as you go.
