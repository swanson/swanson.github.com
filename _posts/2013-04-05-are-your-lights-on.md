**What's the point?**  
Engineers love problem solving. We love coming up with solutions. We are
fascinated by juicy problems, ones that stretch our intellect as we formulate
a fix.

However, if we rush in with solutions before we correctly define the problem
(and who the client  we are trying to satisfy), we will end up solving the wrong
problem. By stopping and thinking  before diving into implementation, we can
avoid this costly mistake.

Most of time, we are tasked with solving the problems of *others*, not
ourselves. Making a mental  shift from "Problem Solver" to "Solver of Problems"
allows us to focus on finding who is impacted by a problem and identifying the
real story behind the problem. There is rarely one problem that can be solved,
but rather multiple parties that must come to a mutually acceptable resolution.

**How was it?**  
The book uses stories to help answer the following questions:

* What is the problem? Whose problem is it? Where does this problem come from?
* Do we really want to solve this problem?

There are a lot of really eye-opening lessons. One in particular was very
topical for my current project:

> Don't mistake a solution method for a problem definition &mdash; especially if
> it's your own solution method.

There are some interesting ideas that I think will make their way into my
"problem vocabulary":

* **Phantom problem** - a problem is a difference between how something is
desired vs how it is perceived; a phantom problem is often attributed to
perception, you can change the perception to solve the problem 
* **Misfit** - a solution that superficially solves the problem, but is not 
usable for those that have to live with it; try to identify these before 
implementing a solution

But the most influential section to me was on forcing yourself to consider that
sometimes *you* are the source of  the problem. If you can shift the source to
yourself, you have complete control over resolving it &mdash; it won't solve the
problem for everyone, but you can go about your life without letting it affect
you anymore.

**Who should read it?**  
I found this book on David Heinemeier Hansson's list of [five most influence
programming books][dhh] and I am really glad I read it. It is a short book
&mdash; I finished it in two sittings &mdash; and I would recommend it to anyone
dealing with arguments about solutions or confusion about problems.
