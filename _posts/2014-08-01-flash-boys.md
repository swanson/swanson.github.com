**What's the point?**  
As the US stock market becomes more and more computerized, it has given rise to a new
industry of high frequency, automated trading. The days of hundreds of brokers, all yelling
across a crowded room and waving papers over their head, are over. 

Now the chaos happens in a data center somewhere, as algorithmic trading models fight to 
be the fastest to respond to market data and jockey for physical proximity to key machines
inside a data center.

**How was it?**  
I came into this book with a pre-existing mental model of high frequency trading (HFT),
due to the increasing media coverage in recent years. I think nearly
every programmer who has entered the field in the past 5 years has been approached
or interviewed with some kind of company that deals with automated trading (they were a 
mainstay at job fairs when I was in school).

I'm a big fan of Michael Lewis (*Moneyball*, *Liar's Poker*, *The Big Short*) and I am
aware of the criticism he receives. Putting aside whether his accounts are always unbiased
or 100% factual, the guy knows how to write a great story and this book was thoroughly
enjoyable.

To give you a sense of the weird intersection of technology and trading, the story opens
with a plan to drill a tunnel **through the side of a mountain** so that a fiber optic cable could
have a straight-line path from Chicago to NYC (thus shaving *milliseconds* off the transmission
time).

Lewis frames the HFT shops as a mysterious and deceptive lot and focuses on the
innovation-slash-righteous-crusade of a Canadien banker who unravels how HFT is influencing
the US stock market.

**Who should read it?**  
This book is something to read for pleasure. It's light on practical advice, but the story
is intriguing, especially given the tie-ins with programming and software.
