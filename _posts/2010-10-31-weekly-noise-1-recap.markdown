title: Weekly Noise - Week 1 Recap

Its been a week since I started my first [Weekly Noise](http://mdswanson.com/blog/2010/10/24/weekly-noise.html)
post and so far, I think it is a success.  Since I had planned out what to work
on in advance, I didn't have to waste much time thinking about what to do when 
I had some downtime.  With that said, I will be continuing this format.

Once I got a decent workflow going for actually making posts (Markdown and I still don't
seem to be getting along), writing the posts was actually pretty quick.  I have been 
using the **awesome** [Showdown](http://attacklab.net/showdown/) tool to do 
WYSIWYG editing of the posts and then running `jeykll --server`
locally to do a formating check and some spot-edits.  By the end of the week,
there was almost no overhead to writing book reviews in this way -- I was 
even able to do one during my lunch break.

I didn't quite finish all the books on my list -- I have **More Joel on Software**
and **Passionate Programmer** to do.  But I had a pretty busy weekend, so I will
catch up on those either tonight or tomorrow.  You can find the writeups that I 
finished on the front page on the site, under the Book Writeup's heading.  Despite falling
a bit short of my goal, I still felt a lot more productive.

I had three projects that I wanted to work on in the next week:

 - Javascript/SVG announcement "board" that could be used on a few monitors around
 my office
 - Expand [Showdown](http://attacklab.net/showdown/) to include the other popular
 markup languages (Textile, RST, Creole)
 - Start working on a fantasy football mobile app with 
 [Titanium Appcelerator](http://www.appcelerator.com/), using the 
 [Yahoo Sports API](http://developer.yahoo.com/fantasysports/) I played around with a couple weeks ago

Ultimately, I decided on the first opinion; so onwards to next week!
