**What's the point?**  
Microinteractions are the small moments of action we take in a product &mdash; 
the details that together make up a feature. The design of these interactions can
make a product more memorable, more enjoyable and easier to use.

**How was it?**  
Really good &mdash; I think this book fills a missing gap for a skill set that is 
becoming increasingly important. This kind of delightful UX is going to be a key
differentiator for products and this book is a must-read.

The book wastes no time diving into the structure of a [microinteraction][m]:

[m]: http://microinteractions.com/

* Trigger - either user or system initiated, something has to kick off the interaction
* Rules - the constraints for an interaction (what can or can't be done, what order, how to prevent errors)
* Feedback - help the users understand the Rules of the microinteraction, determine the best channel for communication (visual, audio, haptic)
* Loops / Modes - use long loops to remember past interactions or improve on them over time; limit modes to infrequent actions as much as possible

Each of these steps are broken down and explained with plenty of examples for real
applications. There is also a really great list of questions to help fix dull
microinteractions that I wish I had for several of my past projects at work.

This is a great reference that I can point to when trying to describe how
to build a delightful user experience. It is a concept that is hard to explain
and having a common language and framework will be very helpful going forward.

**Who should read it?**  
Any developer or designer that wants to work on user-facing products should read
this book ASAP and then go try to implement the concepts in their own work.
