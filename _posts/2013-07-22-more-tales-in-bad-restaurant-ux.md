I've been trying to hold back my rants on restaurant UX after
I went a [little crazy on the new Freestyle Coke machines][f] (I still
hate them with a burning passion), but my beloved McAllister's Deli
has really made a big blunder.

I go to [McAllister's Deli][m] every Monday for [Indy Startup Lab][sl],
rain or shine. Recently, they switched all of their menus to digital, 
displaying the items on ten large vertical monitors.

Visually, they are pretty neat; lots of big pictures of the food and
an attractive color scheme.

But they are absolutely terrible to use!

One of the most important pieces of information for a menu to display
is the ingredients or toppings on an item.

I know what a Club Sandwich *usually* has on it, but is there bacon?
Is there mayonnaise? Is there mustard? What kind of bread? What's the
difference between the King Club and the McAllister's Club?!?

This information is relegated to the very bottom of each column
on the new menu boards. And worse, it only displays the details
for whatever item
is "active". The screens cycle through the list of sandwiches 
[like a carousel][c], only revealing what the heck is on the Spud 
Óle if you happen to glance over at the right time.

The menu items cycle at a 10 second interval so I get to wait nearly
2 minutes to see what comes on my sandwich if I miss it the first time
around. Okay, I could ask at the counter but what is the point of 
listing it all?

The whole menu board is designed like it's a application or
something. It would work great with a mouse `:hover` or if I could
tap the menu item to select it &mdash; but this isn't an app! It's a
32" monitor mounted to the ceiling!

The font size scales based on how many items are in each category
so you have the desserts at 24px and the sandwiches at a squint-worthy
13px write next to each other. You literally cannot read the list of 
sides (a choice that every single customer has to make!) until you 
are at the register. Ugh.

Look, I get it McAllister's CEO &mdash; you are trying to modernize
and make it easier to swap in new menu items. But I can't imagine how
this passed through any kind of user testing. At the end of the day,
every minute spent explaining what is on a sandwich slows down the 
process for everyone. Go to McAllister's during the lunch rush and you
will find a line of the door so speed does matter.

My recommendation: the old menu boards worked great, why don't you
just digitize them instead of rolling out this frustrating carousel of
sadness?
