You've probably heard about [delighting your customers][delight].

A pleasant little surprise can convert someone into a [die-hard fanatic][sierra].

This idea has been popping up in my life a lot recently.

I ordered this [belt][mission] (after seeing it on Shark Tank &ndash; guilty pleasure) and 
when I opened the package there was a hand-written note. It probably took someone 20 seconds 
to do but it made me smile and I showed two other people.

I just finished up some contract work for a local [coffee shop][gh]. Here's what I got in the
mail after the project was completed:

<div class="pic">

</div>

Are you frickin' kidding me? A hand-calligraphified box? Filled with awesome treats?

Think I'll have to hem and haw about doing more work for them in the future? Nope.

I am a firm believer in the idea (some are [not][hbr]) &mdash; but it always seemed like something
that was out-of-reach. Sure, Disney or Zappos or 37signals can delight! It's in
their DNA and culture! I can't think of a way to delight my users...

You know what? It's not that hard.

Delighting users requires a bit of nuance (don't get too cheesy...) &mdash; but you can do it!
You don't have to be some UX prodigy or take a calligraphy class.

I started making a deliberate effort to delight and it has been really fun. Not
only do I put a smile on the face of users, but I actually feel happier working on
the projects. One stupid little joke changes my whole attitude and motivation towards
progressing on the app.

Here's three examples from projects of mine. None of them took more than 30 minutes to
implement. 

* I asked five co-workers to write down 10 phrases that meant "good job". I picked the
best ones and added a random "kudos" message to our [employee happiness app][morale].

<div class="pic">
  <img alt="Random kudos message" title="Nothing's ever gonna keep you down!" src="{{site.url}}/static/morale-delight.png">
</div>

* In my [TV episode tracker][queuerunner], when you run out of items to watch - you 
receive this playful jab. A little humor is always welcome.

* When I started building my [anti-social RSS reader][stringer], one of the first things I added
was this self-aware message in the footer &mdash; reminding myself to stop using the app.
