**What's the point?**  
Like the title suggests, this book drills down into retrospective meetings conducted by agile
software teams. Retrospective meetings are really important, but are often either overlooked
or poorly facilitated.

**How was it?**  
Awesome. This book made me want to try leading the next retrospective meeting for my team.

An important focus of the book is on how to *design* a retrospective. There is more to it than
just getting the team in a room and complaining for an hour.

I really liked the list of activities and exercises, especially because the book clearly explained
WHY to do each activity and what you, as a facilitator, should be trying to gain from them. It's
one thing to say "have everyone write Explorer, Shopper, Vacationer, or Prisoner on a card" - 
but the book explains that you can use this to set understand people's attitude toward the meeting
and adjust your tone/agenda accordingly.

For someone like myself who has never lead a retrospective, this book is a great resource. There
are step-by-step actions to take, with lots of examples and even guidelines for how to time-box
each section.

**Who should read it?**  
All team leads, those looking to become team leads, anyone leading retrospectives - if you
haven't read this book, I think you are really missing out.
