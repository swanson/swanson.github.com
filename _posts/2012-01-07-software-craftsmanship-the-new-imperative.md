**What's the point?**  
The book lays out the concept of software craftsmanship, how it differs from software engineering,
and why your company might want to shift to a craftsmanship model.

**How was it?**  
While slightly dated, this book is a good overview of the "craftsmanship movement". The book
does a good job of explaining what it might look like to work in a craftsmanship environment
and summarizes the different stages a programmer will go through (apprentice, journeymen, master
craftsman).

The sections that outlined how to build a team - by letting a master craftsman hand pick the team - and
the emphasis on maintaining an app through the full life cycle were pretty interesting. I think it 
would be really neat to work in this kind of environment; the focus on quality, learning, team
camaraderie, and being a partner for clients align closely with my current thoughts on an "ideal"
setup.

There was, intentionally, a lack of concrete examples or specific steps to follow but I found myself 
thinking "Okay - this sounds good, but how do I start making this happen at work?" and wanting more.

**Who should read it?**  
Developers with an interest in software craftsmanship, apprenticeship, the "studio model" or managers
looking for advice on building excellent technical teams or introducing the craftsmanship culture to
an organization
