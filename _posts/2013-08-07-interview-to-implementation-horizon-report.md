title: "Interview to Implementation: Horizon Report"
categories:

---

We recently added a new report to my current project at work. I am very
picky about what reports we add to this app &mdash; a stance shaped by
working on a project with an entire "Report Builder" that could generate
tens of thousand of report combinations.

So I thought I'd share some of my process.

Background: The app tracks company projects (who worked on them, what
technologies were used, etc). Employees can also list technologies that
interest them and record external projects that they have worked on
(personal projects, open source, past job, etc).

---

My basic process goes like this: expose some data, let the end-user
play around with it, talk to the end-user and find out what questions
they want answers to based on the data. If those questions are compelling,
create a report to help them answer said questions.

## Interview: Mike, our biz-dev champ

I had Mike poke around the app for a few days and I blocked out an hour 
of time to talk with him about what kind of questions he wanted answers
to from the app. We came up with four main questions and then pick the
top two to dive deeper - one of which was what we called the "horizon
report".

Mike wants to know what kind of work would be interesting to the employees
when he is pursuing new opportunities. If Mike knows that a lot of people
are really excited about Arduino or RubyMotion, he can spend time pursuing
those projects. 

I like Mike :)

During our meeting, I tried to get Mike to tell me stories or examples
to illustrate the need for this data. Sometimes, you both realize that
there aren't any actual use-cases for a report (other than "we have
data, therefore REPORTS!!"). Mike talked about how he has made an effort
to find more Ruby projects because he knows several engineers are
interested in it, but he had to spend a lot of time talking to people
to find that out and it was a small sample size (4-5 engineers out of 100).

While Mike was talking, I tried to sketch out some notes using a weird
shorthand that combines bullet points and UI mockups. I tend to avoid
doing full blown mockups at this time, because people get too bogged down
in the details at this stage. No reason to spend 15 minutes deciding on
which columns to display or what the button text says right now.

## Mockup: What the heck did I write?!

When I got back to my desk &mdash; with the interview still fresh in my 
mind &mdash; I did a quick mockup. It is a good thing mockups are supposed
to be "rough looking" because I'm not great at drawing!

My main goal was to make sure I captured the key features from the
interview and translated them from my shorthand into something I could
give to another developer (or a future version of myself).

I like to make notes on function, rather than graphics. I try to preempt
questions like: what should happen if this field is really long? how many 
results should we show? how should this be sorted? You can see some examples
of that above.

Mike was too busy for a quick look at the mockup, but I was confident it
was pretty close based on our interview. When I had questions, I could
always refer back to the purpose of the report ("what is on the 'tech
horizon' for our engineers?") and make a decision based on alignment to that
purpose.

## Implementation: From paper to pixels

I passed off the mockup to Jackson (another developer on the team) and he
cranked out the report in a few hours. It was smooth sailing with the
annotated mockup.

After seeing it in the app, we made a few tweaks (swapped the "Interests"
and "External Project" sections, show Top 21 vs Top 20 so it would fill the
three-column grid evenly), but overall, the report is pretty close to the
mockup.

## Circle back: Make sure you got it right

We pushed out the feature and I grabbed Mike to take a quick look, he gave
it the thumbs up. A happy user! 

I set an Outlook reminder to ask Mike if the
report has been helpful for 60 days in the future. If it isn't useful, I will
try to kill it or fix the problems.

## Summary

* Don't get bogged down by details when talking to a user/customer
* Make sure there is a clear purpose for a report, don't just build it
because you have the data
* Think ahead to what questions you might have during development and
try to answer them on the mockup
* Be deliberate about getting feedback once a feature has been in use for
a bit. Kill failed features ruthlessly.

It was fun to go soup-to-nuts on a feature. Sometimes working just at the
development level makes your forget that there isn't some magic machine that
spits out specs and mockups. I encourage all developers to 
try shepherding a feature from end-user to "shipped" every once in a while.

If you liked this format, let me know on [Twitter][tw] and I'll try to 
write up a few more.
